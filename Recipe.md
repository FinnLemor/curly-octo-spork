To make pork belly, preheat oven to 180°C (160°C fan forced). Place stock in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add oyster sauce, lemongrass and lime leaves, return to boil then remove from heat.

Place pork in a deep roasting tray. Pour hot stock over, cover and cook for 1hr. Remove pork to a tray. Cover with another tray, weight and refrigerate at least 2 hours.

Cut pork into 4x15cm lengths. Heat a non-stick pan to medium-high heat; brown pork on each side. Cut into 3cm cubes.

Meanwhile, make octopus. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Add lime leaves, lemongrass and salt. Cut octopus in half widthways, remove skin from heads and add heads to water. Return water to boil, then remove octopus, refresh in iced water and set aside.

Grill tentacles for 2-3mins or until golden, then brush with kecap manis. Set aside.

To make dressing, pound chillies and ginger together in a mortar and pestle. Place mixture in a saucepan with vinegar, sugar, oyster and hoisin sauces, stock and sesame oil and bring to a boil. Simmer 5mins, then remove from heat and set aside to cool.

To serve, place cubes of crisp pork belly on a serving platter. Place 4 matchsticks of watermelon and a piece of octopus on top, and secure with a skewer. Garnish with ginger julienne and drizzle dressing over. Finish with coriander leaves.
